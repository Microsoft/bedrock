# bedrock

Bedrock is a set of automation, tooling, and infrastructue stacks for deploying production-level Kubernetes 
clusters with a secure and auditable GitOps workflow.

This project is our humble attempt to combine the collective wisdom of our cloud native community for 
building best practice cloud native Kubernetes clusters, based on real world experience of 
deploying and operating cloud native applications.

## What's in the box?

Bedrock, by default, includes the workflow, platforms, and tools that we believe are the best in class for 
operating a Kubernetes cluster. It includes Terraform scripts for creating the core infrastructure for your cluster
and also, by default, includes a cloud native set of observability infrastructure via a set of "batteries removable"
[Fabrikate](https://github.com/Microsoft/fabrikate) stacks.

Cluster Creation
-   [Cluster Deployment](./cluster): Automated cluster creation
-   [Flux](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux): Secure GitOps Kubernetes Operator

Monitoring (via [fabrikate-prometheus-grafana](https://github.com/timfpark/fabrikate-prometheus-grafana))
-   [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics monitoring and aggregation
-   [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) metrics visualization with Kubernetes monitoring dashboards preconfigured

Log Management (via [fabrikate-elasticsearch-fluentd-kibana](https://github.com/timfpark/fabrikate-elasticsearch-fluentd-kibana))
