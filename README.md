# Bedrock

Bedrock provides patterns, implementation, and automation for operating production Kubernetes clusters based on a GitOps workflow, building on the best practices we have discovered in working with dozens of deployments with customers in operationalizing Kubernetes clusters.

Bedrock helps you:
* Define and maintain infrastructure deployments across multiple clusters.
* Deploy and automate a secure end to end GitOps workflow.
* Deploy and manage service workloads from source code to their deployment in-cluster.
* Observe ongoing deployments across multiple services, their revisions, and multiple clusters utilizing those services.
