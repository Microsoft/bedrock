# Cluster Deployment

Azure is currently the only cloud supported, but we would welcome pull requests for other providers.

## Setup

Bedrock automates cluster deployments and other related infrastructure with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io). If you haven't already, install it:

- [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html)

Bedrock also uses `kubectl` for interacting with Kubernetes clusters:

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
 
For Azure based clusters, you also need the `az` command line tool:

- [az cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

## Creating a new Cluster Environment

In bedrock, each physical cluster that you deploy is as an environment that captures its configuration. 

The typical way to create a new environment is to copy an existing one. For example, for an AKS cluster, copy our generic environment to a new subdirectory with the name of your cluster:

```bash
$ cp -r environments/azure/aks-flux environments/azure/my-cluster
```

Next, edit `environments/azure/my-cluster/cluster.tfvars` (adjusting this for what you named your cluster) and update the following variables (for a full list of customizable variables see `inputs.tf`):

- `resource_group_name` - Name of the resource group for the cluster
- `cluster_name` - Name of the cluster itself
- `dns_prefix`: Base DNS name for accessing the cluster from the internet
- `service_principal_id`, `service_principal_secret`: The id and secret of the service principal used to deploy the AKS cluster.  This is generated using the Azure CLI (see [Creating Service Principal](#creating-service-principal) for generation instructions).
- `ssh_public_key`: Contents of a public key authorized to access virtual machines within the cluster.
- `gitops_ssh_key`: Path to the *private key file* that was configured to work with the Gitops repository.
- `gitops_url`: The git repo to use as the repository of truth in ssh format (eg. `git@github.com:timfpark/fabrikate-cloud-native-materialized.git`). This repo must have a deployment key configured to accept changes from `gitops_ssh_key` (see [Configuring Gitops Repository for Flux](#setting-up-gitops-repository-for-flux) for more details).

In the configuration above, `service_principal_id` should be set to `appId` and `service_principal_secret` set to `password`.

## Deploying Cluster

To deploy the cluster you have defined, execute the following two steps from your cluster environment's directory (eg. `environments/azure/my-cluster`):

```
$ terraform init
```

This will download all of the Terraform modules needed for the deployment.  You can then deploy the cluster with:

```
$ terraform apply -var-file=./cluster.tfvars
```

This will deploy the infrastructure for your cluster and install [Flux](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux)
in the cluster. Flux is an open source project that enables a [gitops](https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request) workflow to deploy resources in a Kubernetes cluster. 

Its operational model is very simple: it monitors a the git repository that you specified above that houses all of the Kubernetes resource
manifest files, and when it detects a change to those resource manifests, it applies those changes to the cluster. 

Once your cluster has been created the credentials for the cluster will be placed in the specified `output_directory` which defaults to `./output`. 

You can copy this to your `~/.kube/config` by executing:

```bash
$ KUBECONFIG=./output/kube_config:~/.kube/config kubectl config view --flatten > merged-config && mv merged-config ~/.kube/config
```

or directly use the kube_config file ala:

```
$ KUBECONFIG=./output/kube_config kubectl get po --namespace=flux` 
```

### Creating Service Principal

If you do not already have a Azure service principal, you can generate one via:

```bash
$ az ad sp create-for-rbac
{
  "appId": "50d65587-abcd-4619-1234-f99fb2ac0987",
  "displayName": "azure-cli-2019-01-23-20-27-37",
  "name": "http://azure-cli-2019-01-23-20-27-37",
  "password": "3ac38e00-aaaa-bbbb-bb87-7222bc4b1f11",
  "tenant": "72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47"
}
```

### Setting Up Gitops Repository for Flux

Flux requires a repository to monitor in order to deploy services to the Kubernetes cluster.  

1.  Create the repo to use for Gitops (this example will assume that you are using Github).
2.  Create (or choose) an SSH key pair that will be given permission to do read/write access to the repository.  Use either
an existing SSH key or to generate an unencrypted key (using linux):

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f gitops_repo_key
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in gitops_repo_key.
Your public key has been saved in gitops_repo_key.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:DgAbaIRrET0rM/U5PIT0mcBFVMW/AQ9sRJ/TsdcmmFA jims@tiremunchie
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|o+Bo=+..*+..E.   |
|oo Xo.o  *..ooo .|
|..+ B+. . =+oo..o|
|.= . B     +. .o |

|                 |
+----[SHA256]-----+
$ ls -l gitops_repo_key*
-rw-------  1 jims  staff  1823 Jan 24 16:28 gitops_repo_key
-rw-r--r--  1 jims  staff   398 Jan 24 16:28 gitops_repo_key.pub
```

3.  Add the SSH key to the repository

Flux currently requires write access to the git repository to store reconcilation state. For Github, the process to add a deploy key is documented 
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/).
